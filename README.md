# Ingint

A Next.js project created to provide a seamless user experience and high performance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ingint.git
cd ingint
```

2. **Setup Environment Variables:**

   - Create a file named `.env.development` in the root directory of the project for development environment variables.
   - Create a file named `.env.production` in the root directory of the project for production environment variables.

   Both files should have the following content, replacing `your backend url` with your actual backend URL:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NLP_API_URL=your backend url/api
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building and Running for Production
